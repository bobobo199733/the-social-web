4714,"   They could have found those documents anytime during the six years the Obama administration end—but COINCIDENTALLY they happen to find them now?🙄

4715, I agree. If Biden had classified documents he needs to be impeached. But you also have to arrest Donald Trump. We cannot play politics with this. The BS corruption has to end. I’m so fed up with it from both sides.
